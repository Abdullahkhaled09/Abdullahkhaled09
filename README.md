👋 Hi, I’m Abdullah Khaled  

AI Engineer & Computer Science undergraduate specializing in **LLM-based systems, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
I build **production-ready AI applications** with a strong focus on **context engineering, evaluation, scalability, and cost efficiency**.  
I’ve worked with international teams across the **US, India, and MENA**, contributing to real-world AI products from experimentation to deployment.

📍 Based in Egypt | 🌍 Open to remote, hybrid, and on-site opportunities

### 🔭 What I work on
- Building **LLM-powered applications** (chatbots, assistants, agents)
- Developing **AI agents & multi-step workflows** using LangChain & LangGraph
- Designing **RAG pipelines** with vector databases for accurate, context-aware retrieval
- Applying **prompt & context engineering** (long-context handling, segmentation, memory)
- Evaluating LLM outputs, **tracking token usage**, and optimizing **cost vs performance**
- Building **scalable backend APIs** for AI systems
- Deploying AI services using **cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines**
