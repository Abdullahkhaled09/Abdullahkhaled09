👋 Hi, I’m Abdullah Khaled

I’m an AI Engineer & Computer Science undergraduate with strong hands-on experience building production-ready AI systems, especially LLM-based applications, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
I’ve worked with international teams across the US, India, and MENA in AI engineering, automation, and computer vision, contributing to real-world products from experimentation to deployment.
I focus on turning LLMs into reliable systems, not just demos ,emphasizing context engineering, evaluation, scalability, and cost efficiency.

🔭 What I’m working on :
- Designing and building LLM-powered applications (chatbots, agents, assistants)
- Developing AI agents & multi-step workflows using LangChain & LangGraph
- Implementing RAG pipelines with vector databases for accurate, context-aware retrieval
- Applying prompt & context engineering (long-context handling, segmentation, memory)
- Evaluating LLM outputs, tracking token usage, and optimizing cost vs performance
- Building scalable backend APIs for AI systems
- Deploying AI services using cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines
